# Data_Engineering_Nanodegree
## Introduction
A ficticious music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project there will be built ETL pipeline that extracts the data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.
