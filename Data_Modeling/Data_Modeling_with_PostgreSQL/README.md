# Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

## Introduction
A startup called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. They'd like to have created a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.

##Project Description
We will build an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
